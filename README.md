This is a python toolkit for generating TimeSeries for ServiceNow Operational Intelligence

the current version of the scripts relies on the following python libraries:
- requests
- datetime
- ConfigParser
- numpy
- pandas

The behavior is driven by the oi_history_generator_config.ini config file.

Notes:
If pandas library installation fails try with "pip install pandas  --no-cache-dir"
